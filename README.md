# Senso

### Choose a meaningful name for that brand new JS framework you are developing

So you want to create a new framework, uh? But how will it stand out from the plethora of already existing ones? It has to have a nice, catchy name. And if that name makes sense with your framework's purpose, that's even better.
What ? You'd rather spend the time for searching that name actually developing?

Fear no more ! With this ***incredible new framework/package/whatever man you have to use this*** called Senso, all of the research will be done for you and you will only have to pick that one name you prefer over the proposed ones! 


### In a more serious tone

Senso uses [moby](https://github.com/words/moby) as a base to retrieve synonyms of the desired idea.

The dictionary.json file is taken from [here](https://github.com/words/moby/blob/master/words.txt).
It has been rearranged as a JSON file for better usability.

You can use pretty much any file following this format (commas for convenience): 

```json
{
  "beer": "drinks,alcohol,beverage",
  "pizza": "food,snack"
}
```
